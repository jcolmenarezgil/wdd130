        <p><b>About my country:</b> Venezuela, a land of unparalleled natural beauty, is home to the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall, Angel Falls. Located in BolÃ­var state, this majestic cascade plunges over 979 meters (3,212 feet) from the Auyantepuy plateau. Surrounded by lush rainforests teeming with exotic wildlife and ancient tepuys, Venezuela offers adventurers a unique opportunity to explore pristine wilderness and marvel at the wonders of nature.</p>
